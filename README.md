# Replication package for Monte Carlo experiments in Chen and Kaido (2023)

This package contains the following files.

- monte_carlo_main.m: The main Matlab file to run the MC experiments;
- summarize_results.m: A Matlab file to summarize the outputs generated by monte_carlo_main.m;
- Simulation_BCS.m: A Matlab file to apply the test by Bugni, Canay, and Shi (2017) to the simulated data.

# How to replicate the simulation results

1. Clone the repository. Or download the files to a local directory.
2. Create directories named "Results" and "Figures" above the directory to which you saved the files. Within "Results", create a subdirectory named "Matfiles".
3. Run monte_carlo_main.m from the command prompt. A sample script file (run_monte_carlo_main.sh) is also contained in this directory.
4. Similarly, run Simulation_BCS.m.
5. Run summarize_results.m.
